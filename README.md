Roadmap For Project:
1. Definition of a genetic algorithm
2. Attributes of HDL code that can be improved via algorithm
3. Defining our success/failure conditions
4. Traditional methods to improve each of those attributes
5. Why a genetic algorithm specifically would be helpful
6. Method to implement the algorithm
7. Creation of the algorithm
8. Testing and results
9. Conclusions


17 June 2025 Update:
Finished "Definition of a Genetic Algorithm" Document added to repository.
